Classifurlr
===========

Description
-----------

Classifurlr is a tool to automatically determine if a given web page or set of
web pages is likely inaccessible.

This tool does not actually fetch any content from the Internet - previously
fetched content is fed into it. The given content is moved through a pipeline
of classifiers, each of which looks for different signatures of
inaccessibility.  Each classifier returns how confident it is that the given
content is inaccessible. These are then pooled to create a final accessibility
verdict.

Right now, the following classifiers are implemented:

* _BlockpageSignatureClassifier_ - detects patterns of text we think are unique
 to block pages. Most patterns are from [OONI](https://github.com/iclab/iclab-dmp/blob/master/primitives/block_page_detection.py).
* _ClassifyPipeline_ - a classifier that pools the results of other classifiers
* _CosineSimilarityClassifier_ - uses cosine similarity between a page and
 a baseline to determine whether a page is unexpected content (like a block
 page). Relevant paper [here](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2014/papers/p299.pdf)
* _DifferingDomainClassifier_ - detects whether the requested domain and the
 final domain are significantly different which could indicate DNS tampering
 or injected redirects.
* _ErrorClassifier_ - classifies all sessions that contain errors as down
* _EmptyPageClassifier_ - classifies all pages that have very little content as
  down
* _PageLengthClassifier_ - detects whether a page contains unexpected content
 (like a block page) by looking at the different lengths of a given page and
 a baseline. Relevant paper
 [here](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2014/papers/p299.pdf)
* _StatusCodeClassifier_ - a simple classifier that says all non-2xx status codes are down
* _ThrottleClassifier_ - detects excessively long load times that might
 indicate throttling

Requirements
------------

* Python 3.x
* pip
* libxml2
* libxslt

Getting Started
---------------

After making sure you have the requirements, install the rest of the
dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The tool can be used in three ways: as a Python module, as a command line
program, and as a web service.

To run Classifurlr as a command line tool, simply run:

```
python classifurlr.py <name of data file>
```
You can see more options by adding the `-h` flag to the above command.

The data file should be a JSON file with the following structure:
```
{
  url: 'http://example.com',
  baseline: false, // 'page_1',
  pageDetail: {
      'page_0': {
          asn: 0,
          screenshot: 'data:image/png;base64,',
          errors: [''],
      },
      ...
  },
  har: {...}
}
```
More details and field definitions for this structure are [in the
wiki](todo).

The tool will return a JSON document that looks like this:
```
{
  "status": "down",
  "statusConfidence": 0.52,
  "classifier": "classification_pipeline",
  "constituents": [
    {
      "status": "down",
      "statusConfidence": 0.4,
      "classifier": "page_length"
    },
    ...
```
Here are the field definitions:
* _status_ - the determined status of the page, `up` or `down`. Right now,
 **this will always return `down`**.
* _statusConfidence_ - how confident the tool is that the given set of pages
 are inaccessible on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0.
* _classifier_ - the name of the classifier that returned this result
* _constituents_ - if the classifier used other classifiers to determine its
 result, this will contain an array of documents that have the same form as
 this document.

Classifurlr also minimally complies to the WSGI spec with the provided `app`
function. To run the tool as a web service, run something like the following:
```
gunicorn classifurlr:app
```
